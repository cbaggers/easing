# Easing

This library includes commonly used easing functions, implemented in Common Lisp. The functions are defined on [0, 1] domain and their codomain mostly lies in [0, 1] as well - only exceptions being functions like bounce and elastic, which overshoot. Included with the library is an example program (implemented using [Sketch](https://github.com/vydd/sketch)).
